# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm @rigma

I'm currently a Full Stack Engineer at [Taster], where I mainly working with [Python] and [Vue].

I also enjoy doing ðŸ¥ž [crÃªpes], but it has nothing to do with the fact I'm working for
a digital restaurant... Or does it? ðŸ¤”

## A quick resume

I'm a French software engineer graduated from [Efrei Paris]. During my school's years,
I've studied computer graphics, but I haven't decide to follow this path after my
graduation.

I've previously worked at [Ornikar] where I served as a Junior Backend Developer, and
I'm now working for [Taster] to help to the development of kitchen-centric IT tools.

I would define myself as a code artisan who he's not afraid to work hard problems, and
enjoy to learn new languages, architecture or programming paradigms.

See you on the commits! _I've managed to one day commit to a big open-source project_ ðŸ™ˆ
